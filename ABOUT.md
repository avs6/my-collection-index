# 👋 About Me

I’m a **systems-first technologist** working at the intersection of **AI infrastructure, agentic systems, and large-scale platforms**.

My core belief is simple:

> **Architecture outlives hype.**  
> Well-designed systems — observable, reproducible, and boring in the right places — scale farther than clever ideas.

## 🧠 How I Think

- **Forks are not bookmarks** — I fork only when I intend to change or maintain code.
- **Models are artifacts, not notebooks** — versioning, lineage, and lifecycle matter.
- **Agents should reason, systems should execute** — strict boundaries and adapters.
- **Infrastructure should be boring** — exciting infra usually means hidden risk.
- **Everything must be observable** — metrics, logs, traces, or it doesn’t exist.

## 🔬 What I Build & Explore

- Agentic platforms with tool boundaries and auditability  
- GenAI & LLM inference pipelines (RAG, latency/cost tradeoffs)  
- MLOps systems for experimentation, deployment, and drift detection  
- Kubernetes & GPU infrastructure on real hardware  
- Event-driven and quantitative system architectures

## 📚 Curation as a Discipline

I maintain a **long-term, low-noise index** of repositories, papers, talks, and tools.

This isn’t a bookmark dump — it’s a **memory system**.

> If something isn’t good enough to index, it isn’t good enough to remember.

## 🚧 What I Care About Long-Term

- Agent systems that are safe, inspectable, and debuggable  
- AI platforms that can actually be operated  
- Clear separation between research, execution, and control  
- Systems that age well — technically and conceptually

## 📍 Outside the Code

I enjoy long-term thinking about systems, leverage, and compounding — whether in software, hardware, or real-world projects.

I value clarity, depth, and work that compounds over time.

### TL;DR

> I build **serious systems** for **real constraints**,  
> curate what matters,  
> and optimize for **long-term signal over short-term noise**.
